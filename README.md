# Finance Monte-Carlo Simulation using PyTorch

- An easy-to-use python package to do Monte-Carlo Simulation on stock prices
- GPU accelerated Monte-Carlo simulation, that could allow simulation more random walkers without a large time penalty

## For Development

Python virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
